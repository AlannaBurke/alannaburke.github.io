description: "There are some great benefits to working with a global team - for instance, no one ever needs to work around the clock, because issues can be handed off as the next “shift” logs in for the day. However, it can be difficult to log off and put work out of your mind when you know someone is always working. How do you establish a mindset that lets you log off guilt-free when your working day is done?    

In this talk, we’ll go over strategies for unplugging, dealing with guilt, and other issues that can crop up in these situations. Attendees will come away with actionable ideas for protecting their time and creating more work/life balance."
