description: "If you’ve been on the internet or watched the news this past year, you’ve heard about AI. Chat GPT, Midjourney, and thousands more tools seem to be taking over. And while they can certainly be useful, and the technology is exciting, it can be hard to determine what content has been generated by a computer and what was created by a human being.   

In this talk, we’ll discuss some of the types of AI content generation and what they produce, and what to look for in order to differentiate between AI and human content, both written and visual. We’ll talk about why it’s important to be able to discern between the two, and the issues surrounding AI-generated content. Users will come away with a better understanding of AI-generated content and what it looks like, as well as how to spot it."
