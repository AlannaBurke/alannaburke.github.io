description: "Imagine diving into an open source project that seems perfectly designed to solve your problems, only to hit a wall due to a lack of clear documentation. This frustrating scenario is all too common in the open source community, where projects burst with potential yet falter in execution due to poor or absent documentation. The absence of well-structured guides, clear examples, and detailed installation instructions can turn an enthusiastic user into a disillusioned passerby.  

In this session, led by Alanna Burke — community manager, developer advocate, and seasoned documentation writer — we will explore why documentation is not just an add-on but a fundamental component of any successful open source project. Alanna will share practical strategies for embedding documentation into the development lifecycle, ensuring that it receives the attention it deserves from the start.   

We will discuss methods to engage the entire community in documentation efforts, from the core team to casual contributors, and demonstrate how well-maintained documentation can drive a project’s growth, facilitate user onboarding, and enhance community contributions. Join us to understand how transforming documentation practices can lead to more robust and resilient open source projects.  "
